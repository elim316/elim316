### [Uncertainty & Explainability in Battery Management AI Systems](https://github.com/elim316/UQ-XAI-battery-analytics)

- Research project exploring uncertainty quantification (UQ) and explainable AI (XAI) for battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation.
- Developed techniques to evaluate both **model confidence** and **data uncertainty** using Monte Carlo Dropout, Gaussian noise injection, and Adaptive Confidence Intervals (ACI).
- Integrated XAI methods including **SHAP**, **LIME**, **Integrated Gradients**, and **Counterfactual Explanations**, with SHAP emerging as the most robust.
- Designed evaluation pipeline with calibration metrics: **ECE**, **MCE**, **PICP**, and interpretability metrics: **Fidelity**, **Consistency**, and **Stability**.
- Built a Streamlit UI for interactive visualisation of predictions, confidence intervals, and model attributions.
- Validated results across the **Oxford** and **McMaster** battery datasets for cross-domain generalisability.
